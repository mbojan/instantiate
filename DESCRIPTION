Title: Pre-Compiled 'CmdStan' Models in R Packages
Description: Similar to 'rstantools' for 'rstan',
  the 'instantiate' package builds pre-compiled
  'CmdStan' models into CRAN-ready statistical modeling R packages.
  The models compile once during installation,
  the executables live inside the file systems of their respective packages,
  and users have the full power and convenience of
  'cmdstanr' without any additional compilation.
  This approach saves time, allows R package developers
  to migrate from 'rstan' to the more modern
  'cmdstanr', and fits well with centrally maintained
  R installations where users have trouble installing
  their own packages, diagnosing compilation errors,
  and setting environment variables.
  Packages 'rstantools', 'cmdstanr', 'stannis', and
  'stanapi' are similar Stan clients with different objectives.
